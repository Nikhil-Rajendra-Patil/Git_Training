            Elements of Visualization
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            Visualization takes in raw data and transforms into charts, graphs, and images that can flawlessly marvelously explain numbers to gain insights from it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Information visualization requires mapping data in a visual or occasionally auditory format for the user of the visualization. 
            This can be challenging because while some data has a spatial relationship built in (for example, temperatures in cities around a country) 
            many data sets don’t have a traditional spatial relationship (for example, salaries within an organization).
        </p>

        <p>
            Henry D Hubbard, who was a member of the US Bureau of Standards in the 1920s, said; “There is a magic in graphs. 
            The proﬁle of a curve reveals in a ﬂash a whole situation — the life history of an epidemic, 
            a panic, or an era of prosperity. The curve informs the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces.”
        </p>

        <p>
            There are three elements to define for an information visualization according to Card, 
            Mackinlay and Sheniederman in their text “Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think”:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 17px;">The Spatial Substrate</li>
            <li style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 17px;">The Graphical Elements</li>
            <li style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 17px;"s>The Graphical Properties</li>
        </ul>     
            
        <h2>
            <b>Line</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
        A line is defined as a mark that connects the space between two points, taking any form along the way.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Shape</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Shapes are an enclosed space and it's limited to two dimensions so it's flat in nature
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Color</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
        A Color is the amount of light that's reflected or refracted off of an object so light plays a really important role in color. 
        Color incorporates the hue the saturation and the value range that we see in colors. 
        The color wheel is a valuable tool to help you decide what colors to use and which going to be the most effective
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Texture</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
        Texture refers to the feel of an object now in design you really actually feel it but it gives the illusion of some kind of a texture.
        Texture can be created using pattern designs so repeating shapes and it gives the illusion of a texture or it can actually mimic real texture.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Space</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Space creates the visual essence and dynamic of a composition. In design, there are two types of space: positive space and negative space. 
            Positive space can be perceived as two dimensional or three dimensional.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Value</b> 
        </h2>

        <p>
            Value is the gradation from light to dark across a form; 
            it is determined both by the lightness and darkness of the object and by its natural color- its local color - 
            and by the degree of light that strikes it. 
            Value is the range from white to black as seen in a grayscale scale.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Size</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Size is simply the relationship between the area occupied by one shape to that of the area occupied by another.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Balance</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Balance is how the elements within a composition are arranged either symmetrically,
            asymmetrically, or radially to create the impression of equality in weight or importance.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Contrast</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Contrast in the context of visual design can be defined as a difference between two or more elements in a composition. 
            The more the difference between the elements, the greater they are easy to compare and comprehend and that’s when they are said to have contrasted with each other.
        </p>

             alt ="Size",

        >

        <h2>
            <b>Emphasis</b>
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            Emphasis deals with the parts of a design that are meant to stand out. 
            In most cases, this means the most important information the design is meant to convey.
        </p>
    
        <img src="C:\Users\nikhi\Downloads\HTML\Emphasis.jpg",
             alt ="Size",

        <h2>
            <b>Pattern</b>
        </h2>
                
        <p>
            Pattern is the repetition of specific visual elements such as a single unit or multitude of forms.
             Patterns can be used to create balance, organize surfaces in a consistent manner, or create contrast.
             An example of this are department store floor tiles. While they serve as decoration, they have another purpose; they lead the customer throughout the store.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Proportion</b>
        </h2>
            
        <p>
            Proportion is the relationship of two or more elements in a design and how they compare with one another. 
            Proportion is said to be harmonious when a correct relationship exists between the elements with respect to size or quantity.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <b>Movement and Rhythm</b>
        </h2>
                
        <p>
            Movement is how the eye moves throughout the composition; leading the attention from one aspect to another. This can be achieved by using repeating or alternating elements or patterns.
             How often something repeats and the intensity of its contrast creates rhythm.
        </p>
                
        <img src="C:\Users\nikhi\Downloads\HTML\Movement-an-Rhythm.jpg",
             alt ="Size",
             width = "800",
             height="450",
        >

        <h2>
            <b>Unity</b>
        </h2>
                    
        <p>
            Unity is the principle of design that unifies all other principles within a piece of work, allowing each individual element to coexist with one another to form an aesthetically pleasing design.
             Ultimately, unity is what gives a design the appearance of cohesiveness despite its internal components differing in scale, contrast, or style.
        </p>
